We are inspired and dedicated to making a positive impact on our earth. We want to create a legacy of change and encourage people to take action to create a better place for all.

Starting out as grade 5 students, we first learned about the Me to We organization. We were inspired by their movement and vision, that encouraged youth that we could make a difference too - that no person or action was too small to make an impact. They inspired students to work locally and globally to impact the lives of people both in their communities and those who were oceans away. Working together, we learned that no action was too small and that one positive change could create a ripple effect - and that’s exactly what happened.",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"As the years went on, we found more and more world issues we wanted to address and help however we could. We have raised awareness for a multitude of world issues such as deforestation, ocean pollution, endangered species, impoverished countries, those without access to clean water or healthcare, and those living in our community who face homelessness. Through fundraisers, events to raise awareness for causes, and volunteering, we have been able to take part in some incredible initiatives that have made a great difference.",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"We started as a team of 10 students with a vision and many ideas, and every year our group continued to grow.

Our group who had graduated wanted to continue to work together as well, so despite going to five different schools, we were able to meet once a month. While it was certainly different than before and was difficult to plan as many fundraisers as we were able to plan previously, we were still just as passionate about making a difference and we wanted to continue working as a group.",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"We got to hear about some incredible events from our old school and the group of younger students that continued to work there - it was incredibly cool to see that the club we started had grown so much.

To this very day, our Changemakers are planning more events and projects as we speak.",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"Now in grade 11, we are overjoyed to be able to look back and see an incredible ripple effect of positive impacts - it has been an amazing journey, and we feel so lucky to have worked on so many different projects, fundraisers and volunteering opportunities that have made a difference to many different people in the world. We feel so thankful to be working alongside great friends who share a passion for positive change and we feel incredibly inspired to continue to help change the world together.",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"We would like to leave you with a few last words. Always remember the impact and importance that one positive action can have. You can make a difference in someone’s life - you will be amazed at the impact that one kind action can have. Always remember to keep dreaming, envisioning and creating a better world, no matter what obstacles you may face - don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t make a difference. Finally, working together is one of the most incredible, inspiring, and effective ways to make our dreams a reality. The only way we’ll achieve a better world for all, is if we keep working together and keep inspiring each other along the way.",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"With lots of appreciation, hope, and kindness,",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"The Changemakers",o.a.createElement("br",null))))}}}]);
