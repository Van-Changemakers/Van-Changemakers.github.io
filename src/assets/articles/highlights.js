    "bio": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made fundraising incredibly challenging. Despite that, we were able to move to an E-Commerce model to raise money for the Lookout Society with cards designed by various group members with various holiday-related phrases (Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas, Season's Greetings, Happy Happy Hanukkah, etc). We promoted this effort through our social media pages and emails to friends and family. Cards could be requested through Instagram DM, by email, or from the new shop page on our website. Once the request has been recieved, delivery location and money e-transfer was organized. In the end, we managed to raise $205 with this fundraiser, and build valuable skills, knowledge, and infrastructure for future online fundraisers we plan to do for much of 2021.",

The first major effort we took was putting a greater focus on our social media. With a new, informational post format, and a new design, we began building an audience and sharing information. The other major effort was the creation of this website to allow for a single place to share upcoming events, fundraisers, and information on what we have done in the past. This new digital presence has been extremely important in everything we've done since the beginning of the pandemic, including a holiday card sale.",

    "bio": "In February 2020 on Valentine’s day, our Changemakers group held a flower sale to raise money for Futures Without Violence as well as the Downtown Eastside Women’s Center. At a time when everyone was thinking about their loved ones, we wanted to make a difference for women and children who may not feel a lot of love or who may be struggling with abuse at home or in their lives. We faced a few obstacles along the way, but the sale turned out to be an incredible success at the end. One of our first obstacles was that as a group that has students from 5 different schools, finding the time to coordinate and plan with everyone all together raises some difficulties. We still held meetings and we coordinated our plans online to see who would be able to come. With six of our team members able to participate on the day of the sale, we spent a few hours on the side of the street selling flowers. We created different prices based on the flowers, made posters, and tried out sales techniques to those who walked by. At the end of the day, working together, raising awareness and money for such an important cause, and being met with kindness by strangers on the street, we were able to accomplish a lot by the end of the day. With over 400$ made for our donation, we hope that we were able to make a difference in someone’s life. This flower sale was one of our most successful fundraisers. Our world is made better with love and kindness from all.\n\nFutures Without Violence is a non-profit organization whose mission is to help all who have been traumatized by violence and to create a violence-free tomorrow. Their public action campaigns, policy development and specialized programs are helping to stop child abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault and bullying.
