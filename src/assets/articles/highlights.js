Despite that, we were able to move to an E-Commerce model to raise money for the Lookout Society with cards designed by various group members with various holiday-related phrases (Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas, Season's Greetings, Happy Happy Hanukkah, etc). We promoted this effort through our social media pages and emails to friends and family. Cards could be requested through Instagram DM, by email, or from the new shop page on our website. Once the request has been recieved, delivery location and money e-transfer was organized. In the end, we managed to raise $205 with this fundraiser, and build valuable skills, knowledge, and infrastructure for future online fundraisers we plan to do for much of 2021.",

The first major effort we took was putting a greater focus on our social media. With a new, informational post format, and a new design, we began building an audience and sharing information. The other major effort was the creation of this website to allow for a single place to share upcoming events, fundraisers, and information on what we have done in the past. This new digital presence has been extremely important in everything we've done since the beginning of the pandemic, including a holiday card sale.",
