    "bio": "The Vancouver Aquarium is one of the most renowned aquariums in Canada.\n Recently, however, it has fallen on tough times. When a new law was implemented saying that the Vancouver Aquarium could no longer house cretans (whales, dolphins, ect) they foresaw a loss of revenue in the future and took out large loans in order to advertise and increase their patrons. Unfortunately, with Covid-19 throwing a dent in things, they are losing almost a million dollars a month. With income decreasing at such an alarming rate, soon they will not have enough to care for the animals. Now is the time to step in and make a difference. \nHereâ€™s how you can help:\nThe Vancouver Aquarium is selling masks to fundraise for the animals, custom designed by the Vancouver Whitecaps. Their gift store is still open and running, and they are accepting any and all donations to the cause. Go to https://www.vanaqua.org/ for more details.",
